# Library-Management-System-Using-Python

When borrowing books, every time you write <u><i><b>show</b></i></u> in the title form, it will print the list of borrowed books as well as the borrower's name. Similarly, using the <u><i><b>show</b></i></u> in the title input in returning the bookÂ will output a list of available books.
